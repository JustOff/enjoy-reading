enjoyreading2
=============

Maintenance fork of the Enjoy Reading addon by jblanche.
This, unlike the upstream, works with current Firefox versions.

The upstream: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/enjoy-reading/>

Note: this is not in AMO for *good* reasons.
Seems that it is impossible right now to submit readability-based add-on.
The reply is broken down in the issues page.
**None of the problems have been introduced in this fork**.
