# Enjoy Reading

Improve the readability of your favorites websites and get the best online reading experience.

Enjoy Reading is heavily based on the [old Readability](https://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/) open source bookmarklet.  
The only difference for now is that there is no more server calls to the readability server, the add-on embbeds all the logic !

Firefox extension available on [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/enjoy-reading/)

Created by [Jonathan Blanchet](http://www.jblanche.fr/).  
Maintained by [Remigiusz Modrzejewski](http://lrem.net/) until end on 2013.

# How to develop

This add-on needs [Mozilla SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK) to be built.

Depends on [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS and JS generation.

# How to help

This add-on tries to guess what is the primary content of a web page.

Currently, guessing is very simple (long text, presence of link, number of comma…), and so, perhaps not very accurate.
